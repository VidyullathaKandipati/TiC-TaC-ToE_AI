# TiC-TaC-ToE AI Version
---
This is AI version of the Tic Tac.
Access the application [here](https://vidyullathakandipati.github.io/TiC-TaC-ToE_AI/)

## background
---
I was supposed to build a tic tac toe game for my project0 as part of my course,
and I built a multiplayer one [here](https://github.com/VidyullathaKandipati/tic-tac-toe)
I wanted to improvise this one in term of code refactoring and also wanted to include AI.

## Features
---
AI - Computer plays against player X, and player X always makes first move.

## Built with
---
* HTML
* CSS
* SCSS (SASS)
* JavaScript
* BootStrap
* jQuery

## Usage
---
User is playerX, hence makes the first always
Computer is player O and makes the move automatically after the playerX's turn.
Scores are displayed on the screen and keeps increasing.
Once the game is Over, nothing happens on the game board until 'New Game' button is clicked.
'New Game' will start a new game and once again, player X / User makes the first move.
If 'Reset Scores' is clicked, it will reset all the scores to 0 and will start a new game.

## Future Release
---
I plan to add some sounds and have sound on / off facility
I also plan to make the game more responsive.
